# Credit-card-checker
It's a implementation of Luhn algorithm for CodeCademy course.
There is several opportunities:

1) Check card number is it valid or not;
2) Find invalid cards in an array of card numbers(which can be number, string or an array);
3) Find out the companies who provided invalid numbers based on IIN (only 4 companies);
4) Fix the number so it became valid.
